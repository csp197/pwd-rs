pwd-rs is a Rust based implementation of the Unix pwd program.

NAME

     pwd-rs â€“ return working directory name

SYNOPSIS

     ./pwd-rs [-L | -P]

DESCRIPTION

     The pwd-rs utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard output.

     Unix based operating systems provide pwd, which should ideally be identical to this utility.

     The options are as follows:

     -L      Display the logical current working directory.

     -P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic links resolved).

     If no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.

ENVIRONMENT

     Environment variables used by pwd-rs:

     PWD      Logical current working directory.

EXIT STATUS

     The pwd-rs utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES

     Show current working directory with symbolic links resolved:

           $ ./pwd-rs -P
           /usr/home/csp

     Show the logical current directory.  Then use file(1) to inspect the /home directory:

           $ ./pwd-rs
           /home/csp
           $ file /home
           /home: symbolic link to usr/home

HISTORY

     The pwd command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.

     This pwd-rs utility is not available anywhere unless you clone this repo and install it yourself.

BUGS

     The -L option does not work unless the PWD environment variable is exported by the shell.
